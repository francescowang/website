Kubernetes networking is a complex but powerful system that abstracts physical network details into a software-defined model. It ensures that pods can communicate with each other, services are accessible to users, and the cluster remains secure.

## The Kubernetes Network Model

The foundation of Kubernetes networking is built on the "IP-per-Pod" model. Every Pod in a cluster gets its own unique, cluster-wide IP address.

- **Flat Network:** All Pods can communicate with each other across nodes without needing Network Address Translation (NAT).
- **No Port Mapping:** Pods don't need to map container ports to host ports, simplifying communication between microservices.
- **Shared Namespace:** Containers within the same Pod share the same network namespace and can communicate via `localhost`.

## Kubernetes Services: Stable Endpoints

Since Pods are ephemeral and their IP addresses change when they are recreated, Kubernetes uses **Services** to provide stable endpoints.

### The Four Service Types

1. **ClusterIP (Default):** Exposes the Service on an internal IP within the cluster. This is used for internal microservice communication.
2. **NodePort:** Exposes the Service on each Node’s IP at a static port. This allows external traffic to reach the Service via `<NodeIP>:<NodePort>`.
3. **LoadBalancer:** Used in cloud environments to create an external load balancer (e.g., AWS ELB, GCP LB) that routes traffic directly to the Service.
4. **ExternalName:** Maps a Service to a DNS name (e.g., `db.example.com`) by returning a `CNAME` record, useful for integrating external dependencies.

## Ingress: Layer 7 Routing

While a `LoadBalancer` Service is simple, **Ingress** provides more sophisticated routing. It acts as an entry point that manages external access to services, typically via HTTP/HTTPS.

- **Path-Based Routing:** Route traffic to different services based on the URL path (e.g., `/api` vs `/static`).
- **Host-Based Routing:** Route traffic based on the hostname (e.g., `app.example.com` vs `blog.example.com`).
- **TLS Termination:** Ingress controllers can handle SSL/TLS certificates, offloading encryption tasks from the application.

## Network Policies: Securing the Flow

By default, all Pods in a Kubernetes cluster can talk to each other. **Network Policies** act as a built-in firewall to restrict this communication.

- **Isolation:** You can define rules to allow or deny traffic based on Pod labels, namespaces, and IP blocks.
- **Ingress and Egress:** Policies can control both incoming (ingress) and outgoing (egress) traffic.
- **Security Best Practices:** Implementing a "deny-all" default policy and explicitly allowing necessary traffic is a key step in hardening a cluster.

## Conclusion

Understanding Services, Ingress, and Network Policies is essential for any Kubernetes operator. This combination of stable endpoints, intelligent routing, and granular security controls makes Kubernetes a robust platform for modern distributed applications.
