In a Kubernetes cluster, you don't want to hardcode IP addresses. Pods are ephemeral, and Service IPs (while stable) are still just numbers. To make communication reliable and human-readable, Kubernetes provides a built-in DNS service (usually **CoreDNS**).

## The Internal Phonebook

Whenever you create a Service, Kubernetes automatically assigns it a DNS name. This allows Pods to talk to Services using names like `my-db` instead of `10.96.0.10`.

```text
[ Pod A ] -- "Where is 'my-svc'?" --> [ CoreDNS ]
                                         |
[ Pod A ] <--- "It's at 10.96.45.2" ------+
    |
    +-----> [ Service: my-svc ] (10.96.45.2)
```

## Service DNS Records

The format for a Service's fully qualified domain name (FQDN) is:
`<service-name>.<namespace>.svc.cluster.local`

### 1. Normal Services
A standard Service gets an `A` or `AAAA` record that points to its **ClusterIP**.

### 2. Headless Services
If you set `clusterIP: None`, the DNS query returns the list of **Pod IPs** directly, rather than a single Service IP. This is useful for stateful applications like databases where you might need to connect to a specific instance.

```text
Query: "db-headless.prod.svc.cluster.local"

Response:
- 10.244.1.5 (Pod 0)
- 10.244.2.8 (Pod 1)
- 10.244.1.9 (Pod 2)
```

## Pod DNS Records

Pods also get DNS records, though they are less commonly used directly. The format is usually based on the Pod's IP address:
`<ip-with-dashes>.<namespace>.pod.cluster.local`

Example: `10-244-1-5.default.pod.cluster.local`

## DNS Search Paths: The "Short Name" Magic

Why can you just type `curl my-svc` instead of the full FQDN? Kubernetes configures the `/etc/resolv.conf` inside every Pod with a set of **search paths**.

```text
# Example /etc/resolv.conf inside a Pod
search my-ns.svc.cluster.local svc.cluster.local cluster.local
nameserver 10.96.0.10
options ndots:5
```

When you look up `my-svc`, the resolver tries:
1. `my-svc.my-ns.svc.cluster.local` (Found!)
2. `my-svc.svc.cluster.local`
3. `my-svc.cluster.local`

## Troubleshooting DNS

If a Pod can't find a Service, the first step is usually to check if CoreDNS is running:
`kubectl get pods -n kube-system -l k8s-app=kube-dns`

Or use a temporary "debug" Pod to run a manual lookup:
`kubectl run nslookup --image=busybox:1.28 -it --restart=Never -- nslookup my-svc`

## Summary

Kubernetes DNS is the glue that makes microservices manageable. By providing predictable, namespace-scoped names for every Service, it abstracts away the complexity of networking and allows your applications to stay connected as the cluster scales.
